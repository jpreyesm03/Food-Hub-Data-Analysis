# FDS Project - Data Science Analysis

This repository contains a data science project developed to perform an end-to-end analysis of a dataset. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization techniques, and business insight. *The dataset and the questions were given by MIT IDSS.*

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the complete workflow of a typical data science task, including:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: 
   - Handles missing values.
   - Encodes categorical features.
   - Standardizes numerical data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Provides statistical summaries.
   - Visualizes data distribution and relationships between variables using graphs and plots.

3. **Visualization**: 
   - Creates static and interactive visualizations to present insights effectively.
   - Tools include Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

4. **Key Findings**:
   - Highlights critical insights derived from the analysis.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Analysis Pipeline**: Covers the entire process from raw data to actionable insights.
- **Customizable**: Modify parameters or replace datasets to use the workflow for different problems.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Leverages modern plotting libraries to make findings more accessible.
- **Reusable Code**: Modular implementation of functions for scalability and efficiency.

## Technical Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Tools and Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn
  - Plotly
  - Jupyter Notebook

## Takeaways

- Getting familiar with data preprocessing techniques for real-world datasets.
- Finding the best graphical tools for visualizing trends, correlations, and distributions.
- Building reusable and scalable code for data science tasks.
- Generating valuable and applicable business insight.
